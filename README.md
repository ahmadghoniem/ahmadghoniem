### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My Name is Ahmad and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet.
I also have a thing for crafting robots and gadgets with embedded systems as an electrical engineering student in their final year.
I believe that everyone should have a favourite quote, so mine is "Continuous improvement is better than delayed perfection." - Mark Twain.
My interest in web development goes way back to 2015 when I wanted to create a movie streaming website turns out hacking this website together taught me alot about HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MYSQL.
Fast Forward to today after pursuing a degree in electrical engineering I really wanted to get back to web development.
Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
HTML 5
CSS 3
Javascript (ES6+)
React
Tailwind
RESTful APIs
currently learning Typescript and nextjs
